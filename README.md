_I am Chean Bernard V. Vergel.  I am 18 years old and currently I am a first year college student taking my Bachelors' degree in Computer Engineering at Polytechnic University of the Philippines.  I believe that technology is something that has completely changed the way we live today and I am excited to be part of this ever-evolving world.  A famous quote I always like to keep in mind is "The only way to predict the future is to create it." - Abraham Lincoln._

# _**My Simple App Calculator**_  

_Let this program seperate your even and odd numbers!_

# 🟥 🟥 🟥 _**Introduction**_ 🟥 🟥 🟥
> The program allows the user to select from four basic mathematical operations, namely addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The user interface is designed to prompt the user to select an operation and input two numbers. The program then calculates the result and displays it. The pyfiglet module is used to create a header with the title "Simple App Calculator". The program runs in an infinite loop until the user decides to quit. If the user enters an invalid input, the program prompts the user to enter a valid number.

# 🟥 🟥 🟥 _**Features**_ 🟥 🟥 🟥
- > The code **imports the pyfiglet module** for printing fancy text.
- > The code prints a **welcome message in fancy text** using the pyfiglet module.
- > The code prints a **menu of available operations** (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) using emoji and colored text.
- > The code **prompts the user to select an operation** by entering a corresponding letter (a, b, c, or d).
- > The code **handles invalid input** by printing an error message and asking the user to try again.
- > The code **checks if the user's input is valid** (numeric).
- > The code **handles invalid input by printing an error message** and asking the user to try again.
- > The code **performs the selected operation and prints the result** using emoji and colored text.
- > The code **loops back to the beginning**, allowing the user to perform more calculations or exit the program.
